# Passwordle Design Document

## Overview

Passwordle is a web application that implements a unique "Forgot Password" flow using a Wordle-style game mechanic. Instead of traditional email-based password recovery, users must guess their password through an interactive word-guessing game.

## Core Features

### 1. Login Page

- Clean, modern interface with a professional design
- Input fields for username and password
- "Login" button
- "Forgot Password" link with "try me!" highlight
- Invalid credentials message for any login attempt

### 2. Passwordle Game

- Wordle-style interface
- No word length limitation
- Random password selection from commonPasswords list
- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect letter positions
- Game state persistence during the session

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- React.js for the UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Local storage for game state management

### Components Structure

## User Flow

1. **Initial Landing**

   - User arrives at the login page
   - Sees username/password form
   - Notices highlighted "Forgot Password" link

2. **Login Attempt**

   - User enters any credentials
   - System responds with "Invalid credentials" message
   - Form remains interactive

3. **Password Recovery**

   - User clicks "Forgot Password" link
   - System randomly selects a password from commonPasswords
   - Transitions to Passwordle game interface

4. **Passwordle Game**
   - User sees empty game board
   - Can input guesses of any length
   - Receives visual feedback for each guess
   - Game continues until correct password is guessed

## Data Structures

### Game State

```typescript
interface GameState {
  targetPassword: string;
  currentGuess: string;
  guesses: string[];
  gameStatus: "playing" | "won" | "lost";
  startTime: Date;
}
```

### Password List

```typescript
const commonPasswords: string[] = [
  // List of common passwords
  // Will be populated with real-world examples
];
```

## Game Mechanics

### Core Rules

- Maximum 6 attempts to guess the password
- Each guess must be a valid password from the commonPasswords list
- Feedback is provided after each guess
- Game ends when:
  - Correct password is guessed (win)
  - 6 incorrect attempts are made (loss)
  - User gives up (loss)

### Letter Feedback System

- Green (#538d4e): Letter is correct and in correct position
- Yellow (#b59f3b): Letter is in password but in wrong position
- Dark Gray (#3a3a3c): Letter is not in password
- Light Gray (#818384): Keyboard key state (used but incorrect)

### Grid Layout

- 6 rows (one for each attempt)
- Dynamic column width based on password length
- Each cell is 62px Ã— 62px
- Cell border: 2px solid #3a3a3c
- Cell margin: 5px
- Grid centered on screen with max-width of 500px

### Keyboard Layout

- Dynamic keyboard layout based on characters in commonPasswords list
- Keys are arranged in rows of maximum 10 keys each
- Key size: 43px Ã— 58px
- Key spacing: 6px
- Key colors:
  - Background: #818384
  - Text: #ffffff
  - Used keys follow the same color scheme as grid cells
- Special characters (if present in passwords) will be included
- Keys are arranged in order of frequency in the password list
- Example layout (if passwords contain letters, numbers, and special characters):
  ```
  Q W E R T Y U I O P
  A S D F G H J K L M
  Z X C V B N 1 2 3 4
  5 6 7 8 9 0 ! @ # $
  ```

### Keyboard Generation Logic

```typescript
interface KeyboardConfig {
  maxKeysPerRow: number;
  keySize: {
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
  keySpacing: number;
}

function generateKeyboardLayout(passwords: string[]): string[][] {
  // Extract unique characters from passwords
  const uniqueChars = new Set(passwords.join("").split(""));

  // Sort characters by frequency in passwords
  const charFrequency = new Map<string, number>();
  passwords
    .join("")
    .split("")
    .forEach((char) => {
      charFrequency.set(char, (charFrequency.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    });

  const sortedChars = Array.from(uniqueChars).sort((a, b) => (charFrequency.get(b) || 0) - (charFrequency.get(a) || 0));

  // Arrange characters into rows
  const rows: string[][] = [];
  let currentRow: string[] = [];

  sortedChars.forEach((char) => {
    if (currentRow.length >= 10) {
      rows.push(currentRow);
      currentRow = [];
    }
    currentRow.push(char);
  });

  if (currentRow.length > 0) {
    rows.push(currentRow);
  }

  return rows;
}
```

## Security Considerations

- No actual password storage or verification
- All game logic runs client-side
- Random password selection for demonstration only
- No sensitive data transmission

## Future Enhancements

1. Difficulty levels
2. Statistics tracking
3. Share results functionality
4. Custom word lists
5. Multi-language support

## Development Guidelines

1. Mobile-first responsive design
2. Performance optimization
3. Clean code principles
4. Comprehensive error handling
